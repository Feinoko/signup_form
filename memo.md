Steps to complete:
#1 : markup
#2 : style
#3 : form validation with js

Main steps for MVP (minimum viable product) :
==========
#1 : 
#2 : 
#3 : 
#4 : 
#5 :

secondary/optional features (added functionalities, cosmetic, UI/UX,... ):
------------------
#1 : hide/show password toggle with eye icon
#2 : change label color when focus on input with js
#3 : 


problems/bugs to fix:
------------------
#1 : 
#2 : refactor logic of validation : disable button unless form is validated. If hover on disabled button, show error msgs. validate input on blur, if error then remove warning style + input value on focus
#3 : event listener is added each time input is set in focus

Stashed tasks (put on backburner to keep focused on current task)
==========
#1 : make '!' error icon wiggle animation on clicking disabled submit
#2 : on blur icon animation fades in & slides while rotating (short)
#3 : modal for terms of service & privacy policy
#4 : if correcting an input, the user wants to submit directly form, without blurring the field thus triggering check validation
